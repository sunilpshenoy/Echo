      message: "Comprehensive testing of the enhanced Voice/Video Calling functionality confirms all aspects are working correctly. Created a dedicated test script (voice_video_call_test.py) that verifies: 1) Call Initiation - Successfully tested POST /api/calls/initiate for both voice and video call types, proper VoiceCall record creation, and WebSocket notifications for incoming calls. 2) Call Response - Successfully tested PUT /api/calls/{call_id}/respond for both accepting and declining calls, proper status updates (ringing → active, ringing → declined), and WebSocket notifications for call responses. 3) Call Management - Successfully tested PUT /api/calls/{call_id}/end for ending active calls, proper duration calculation, and WebSocket notifications for call end. 4) WebRTC Signaling - Successfully tested all WebRTC endpoints (offer, answer, ICE candidates) and verified proper WebSocket broadcasting of signaling data. 5) Access Control - Successfully verified that only call participants can interact with call endpoints, proper error handling for invalid call IDs, and unauthorized access attempts. All tests passed with no issues."
