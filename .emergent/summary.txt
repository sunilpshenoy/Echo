The previous AI engineer successfully rebranded Authentic Connections to Pulse, implementing core features like multilingual support (11 languages), PWA installability, and UI refinements. A recurring challenge was persistent ESLint errors, often bypassed, and initial premature confirmations of fixes. The engineer iteratively debugged and leveraged a  to resolve complex issues, demonstrating adaptability. The work progressed through distinct phases: implementing Teams chat, then voice/video calling, enhancing file sharing, and finally, adding comprehensive emoji, GIF, and customization features. The current state involves addressing compilation errors identified post-implementation of these features, particularly frontend component import issues and undefined variables, as identified by the . The overall trajectory shows a focus on core communication functionalities and rich user interaction elements.

The Authentic Connections app, now Pulse, aims to foster genuine bonds using a 5-layer progressive trust system and AI-driven authenticity rating. It transitioned to a freemium model with a trustworthy, calming, intentional, and beautiful UI. Key features include Chats (1-to-1 messaging, PIN connections, calls, file sharing), Teams (group chats), and Premium (AI compatibility, trust progression). Initial goals encompassed functional free-tier features, a mobile (PWA) experience, real-time chat, and the Trust System. Recent enhancements specifically focused on comprehensive rebranding (new logo, color scheme, UI), robust multilingual support for 11 languages (English, Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati, Urdu, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi), file sharing, and message search. The objective is to provide a rich, interactive, and personalized communication platform.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Core FastAPI backend. It was extended with new endpoints for:
    *   Team messaging (leveraging existing ).
    *   Voice/Video call management (e.g., , , ).
    *   Emoji reactions (, ).
    *   Custom emojis ().
    *   A  BaseModel was identified as existing.
-   ****: Main React component. Critical for multilingual support by persisting language from  and forcing re-renders via . No direct changes within the trajectory, but its  listener was crucial for fixes.
-   ****: Main post-login UI. Modified to integrate the Pulse logo as a background watermark, fix Premium Premium label, and implement WhatsApp-style settings button. More recently, it was updated to import and utilize the new  component, managing its state and visibility.
-   ****: 1-on-1 communication. Heavily modified to integrate:
    *   WebSocket for real-time messaging, including team chats.
    *   Enhanced file sharing with progress indicators and drag-and-drop.
    *   Voice/Video call functionality by integrating  and handling WebRTC signaling.
    *   Emoji functionality: integration of  and  components, handling emoji selection and display.
    *   GIF functionality: integration of  and handling GIF messages.
-   ****: Group communication. Significant changes to add messaging capabilities with WebSocket support, paralleling .
-   ****: Configures . Its setup was key for language persistence and fallback across 11 languages.
-   ****: Translation files (e.g., , ). New translation keys were added for team chat, call functionality, emojis, and GIFs.
-   ****: Language selection UI. Initially caused issues due to , which was removed.
-   ** & **: PWA manifest and service worker. Enhanced for Pulse branding, PWA installability, caching, and push notifications.
-   ****: The main branding asset, used in AuthScreen, PWA icons, and as a watermark.
-   **New components in **:
    *   ****: Created for handling the dedicated UI and logic for voice/video calls.
    *   ****: Created to provide a comprehensive emoji selection interface.
    *   ****: Created to display and manage emoji reactions on messages.
    *   ****: Created for searching and selecting GIFs.
    *   ****: Created for user-driven UI theme customization.
-   ****: Regularly updated to document progress, test results, and implementation plans. Crucial for tracking the multi-phase development.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed the implementation of a comprehensive emoji, GIF, and customization suite, as per the user's request to Complete week 3 and 4. This included creating new frontend components like , , , and . Backend support for emoji reactions and custom emojis was also added to .

However, after these implementations, compilation errors were reported by the user (Compilation errors, please resolve. Clean code and test properly). The engineer identified that the newly created frontend components were not being found, leading to import issues. Specifically, , , , and  files were not successfully created in the  directory in earlier attempts.

The engineer's immediate action was to:

2.  Recreate the missing files: , , , and .
3.  After successful compilation, the backend testing for the new emoji/GIF/customization features passed.

The user then requested Compilation error still persists, please resolve and complete front end testing. The engineer confirmed compilation success but then used  to identify potential runtime issues. The  identified specific problems in , namely:
-   An import issue with  (it was being imported but not used, or potentially misused if  was removed as a dependency).
-   Undefined variable references (e.g., ,  might not be properly bound or defined).

The current work is precisely at the point where these identified issues need to be fixed in .
