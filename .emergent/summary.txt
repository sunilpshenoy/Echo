The previous AI engineer successfully established the Authentic Connections application, covering both frontend and backend. A significant recurring challenge was persistent ESLint compilation errors, which the engineer often bypassed or attempted to fix by disabling linting. Despite this, core features like PWA conversion, chat, teams, and a 5-Layer Trust System were built. The recent focus shifted from core functionality polish (file sharing, message search) to extensive branding and multilingual support. The engineer successfully rebranded the app to Pulse, updated its visual identity, and implemented comprehensive multilingual support for 11 languages, including prominent Indian languages. However, the exact logo recreation proved challenging, leading to a placeholder. The multilingual implementation required several iterations to ensure full UI translation and language persistence across the application, with some elements still needing attention. The current state reflects a functional, rebranded, and largely multilingual application, with ongoing refinements.

The Authentic Connections app, now rebranded as Pulse, aims to foster genuine bonds using a 5-layer progressive trust system and an AI-based authenticity rating. It transitioned from ChatApp Pro Ultimate to a freemium model with a trustworthy, calming, intentional, and beautiful UI. Core features include Chats (1-to-1 messaging with PIN connections, calls, file sharing), Teams (group chats), and Premium (formerly Discover, offering AI compatibility and trust progression). The initial goal was functional free-tier features, mobile (PWA) experience, real-time chat, and the 5-Layer Trust System. Recent work included enhancing file sharing and message search, rebranding to Pulse with a new logo and color scheme, and implementing comprehensive multilingual support for 11 languages, including prominent Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati, Urdu, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, English).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing ongoing multilingual issues and UI refinements following the Pulse rebrand. The user reported:
1.  **Untranslated content in post-login tabs**: Specifically, Teams tab content and Premium tab content (formerly Discover) were still displaying in English, despite the main tabs themselves being translated.
2.  **Settings button placement**: The user requested that the settings tab/button be shifted to appear under the user's name letter/avatar for better UX.

The engineer acknowledged these issues and is currently beginning to fix them systematically. The previous efforts successfully translated the main navigation tabs (Chats, Teams, Premium) and key UI elements on the login page and chat interface (Chats heading, Connected status, No messages yet). Language persistence across logins and refreshes was also addressed. The current focus is extending this translation coverage to the *content* within the Teams and Premium interfaces, and refining the UI layout by relocating the settings access point.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to translate the content within the 'Teams' and 'Premium' tabs, and relocate the settings access point.
