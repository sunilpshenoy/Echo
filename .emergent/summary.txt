The previous AI engineer successfully transformed Authentic Connections into Pulse, delivering core features like multilingual support (11 languages), PWA, real-time chat, voice/video calls, enhanced file sharing, and a comprehensive emoji, GIF, and UI customization suite. A recurring challenge involved ESLint warnings and initial compilation issues, which were iteratively debugged, including a critical  version downgrade. The work then transitioned into a major new feature: an extensive group discovery and activity creation interface. This included significant backend API enhancements for recommendations and activity management, alongside substantial frontend UI development. Immediately before the summary request, the engineer was actively implementing three high-priority features: Map View, Sub-groups/Channels, and Calendar Integration, having completed the backend setup and initial frontend component creation, and was in the process of fixing a JSX syntax error in  that arose during the integration of the new Channels interface.

<product_requirements>
The Pulse application, formerly Authentic Connections, aims to build genuine community bonds through a 5-layer progressive trust system and AI-driven authenticity rating, operating on a freemium model with a trustworthy, calming, intentional, and beautiful UI. Core functionalities include:
-   **Chats:** 1-to-1 messaging, PIN connections, voice/video calls, and robust file sharing.
-   **Teams:** Group communication, now significantly enhanced with a comprehensive group discovery and activity creation interface.
-   **Premium:** AI compatibility and trust progression features.

Initial goals focused on a functional free-tier, PWA for mobile, real-time chat, and the Trust System. Recent work has delivered:
-   **Rebranding:** New Pulse logo and color schemes.
-   **Multilingual Support:** Full localization across 11 languages (EN, HI, BN, TE, TA, MR, GU, UR, KN, ML, PA).
-   **Enhanced Messaging:** Comprehensive emoji selection, message reactions, GIF sharing, and message search.
-   **Advanced UI Customization:** User-driven theme customization.
-   **Group Discovery & Activities:** A rich interface for finding groups (smart search, categories, location filters), managing activities (recurring events, collaborative planning, safety check-ins), and social engagement (achievements, recommendations). This significantly enhances the Teams experience.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: The core FastAPI backend. It was extended for:
    -   Teams chat, voice/video calls, emoji reactions, and custom emojis.
    -   Recently, comprehensive group discovery:  (with filters),  (AI-powered), , and endpoints for joining/leaving groups.
    -   Enhanced team creation to support new fields (categories, locations, tags, emojis, privacy).
    -   Activity management endpoints (, join, propose, vote, check-in, feed).
    -   Achievement and analytics logic (group health score, relevance scoring).
    -   Implemented missing  and  functions.
    -   Modified to support sub-groups/channels, map view, and calendar integration endpoints (initial backend foundation laid).
-   ****: Main React component managing application flow, multilingual support via , and authentication state. No direct changes in the visible trajectory, but crucial for context.
-   ****: Main post-login UI. Modified to integrate the Pulse logo, fix Premium Premium label, implement WhatsApp-style settings button, and incorporate . Most recently, it was heavily updated to replace  with  and add new tabs for , , and .
-   ****: Handles 1-on-1 communication. Heavily modified to integrate WebSocket for real-time messaging, enhanced file sharing, voice/video call functionality via , , , and . Key fixes involved  import ( to ) and fixing an  variable to .
-   ****: Handles group communication. Modified for WebSocket support. This component was initially replaced by  in , but is now being re-integrated to support the  for sub-groups.
-   ****: Configures  for multilingual support.
-   ****: Translation files. New keys added for team chat, call functionality, emojis, GIFs, and extensively for group discovery, activities, and new features (Map View, Channels, Calendar). A JSON syntax error (duplicate section) in  was fixed.
-   **New components in **:
    -   ****: Dedicated UI/logic for voice/video calls.
    -   ****: Emoji selection interface.
    -   ****: Displays/manages emoji reactions.
    -   ****: Searches/selects GIFs.
    -   ****: User-driven UI theme customization.
    -   ****: The comprehensive group discovery and activity creation interface, including smart recommendations and advanced filters.
    -   ****: (Newly created) For geographic visualization of groups/activities.
    -   ****: (Newly created) For sub-groups/channels within teams.
    -   ****: (Newly created) For calendar integration of activities.
-   ****: Used for documenting test results, progress, and communication with testing agents.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing three high-priority features: **Map View**, **Sub-groups/Channels**, and **Calendar Integration**.

The work flow was:
1.  **Backend Foundation**: Initial modifications were applied to  to support the new features, laying the API groundwork for map data, channels within teams, and calendar event management.
2.  **Frontend Component Creation**: The engineer successfully created the new React components:
    -   
    -   
    -   
3.  **Dashboard Integration**:  was updated to import these new components and integrate them into the main tab navigation. New tabs were added for Map View, Channels, and Calendar, replacing or extending existing sections.
4.  **TeamsInterface Integration for Channels**: The engineer then proceeded to integrate the new  into the  component, aiming to enable sub-group functionality within existing teams.
5.  **Current Challenge**: During this integration, a  was encountered in  after an edit attempt. The engineer recognized that the file might have been corrupted during the previous write and is currently in the process of fixing  to resolve this compilation error and proceed with the integration.
The current state is that the backend has initial support for these features, the new frontend components exist,  is updated to display them, but  requires a fix before the frontend can successfully compile and display the new Channels functionality.
